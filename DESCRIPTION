Description: rNet is a R package for implemetatoin of a forwardfeed neural net for classificaion problems. 
            Hidden layers use ReLu activation function. The output layer has a sigmoid activation function. 
            Layers have an additional node for bias. Wieghts are trained using traditional backpropogation.
            rNet is sourced in C++. Neural nets are built by using an object-oriented approach.
